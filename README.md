The `Student Performance Prediction System` is a `machine learning-based application` designed to predict academic performance of students based on various factors. The project likely uses educational data to build predictive models that can identify patterns and correlations between student characteristics, behaviors, and their academic outcomes.
Key aspects of this project may include:

- Data collection and preprocessing of student information
- Feature selection to identify important predictors of academic success
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms to create predictive models
- Evaluation of model performance and accuracy
- A user interface for inputting student data and viewing predictions

This type of system could be valuable for educational institutions to identify students who may need additional support early on, allowing for timely interventions. It could help educators, administrators, and even students themselves understand the factors that most significantly impact academic success.

## Features

1. `Predictive Modeling:` Implements machine learning algorithms to forecast student academic performance based on historical data and various attributes.
2. `Multi-factor Analysis:` Analyzes multiple variables that affect student performance such as attendance, previous grades, study time, family background, and extracurricular activities.
3. `Data Visualization Dashboard:` Provides graphical representations of performance metrics, prediction results, and correlation between different factors.
4. `Early Intervention Identification:` Identifies at-risk students who might need additional support before their performance significantly deteriorates.
5. `Performance Tracking:` Monitors student progress over time and compares actual performance against predicted outcomes to continually improve the prediction accuracy.


## 1Key components:
- **Frontend**: Utilizes Flask, Html, CSS for the user interface.
- **API Gateway**: Built with Flask, handles routing and authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Run the `environment.yml` file to create conda env and download all required library

```bash
    conda env create -p ./env -f environment.yml -y
```

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions to set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnoopGeorge418/StudentPerformance-Prediction_System
cd StudentPerformance-Prediction_System
```

### Quick Start

A minimal example to get the application running:

```bash
# Start the development server
python app.py

- The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
```
